<2022-09-15 Thu 22:08>: I used the following contents in the 'config.ru' file:
#+begin_src ruby
require "sinatra"

# NOTE: By using the '< Sinatra::Base' inheritance section, we
# are able to inherit all of the base methods from Sinatra itself:
class Shark < Sinatra::Base
    get "/baby_shark" do
        "<h1>We have a baby shark!</h1>"
    end
end

run Shark
#+end_src

I then ran the following 'rackup config.ru' command in a new terminal:
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-3/phase-3-lecture-videos-sinatra-intro
 $ rackup config.ru
[2022-09-15 22:10:07] INFO  WEBrick 1.6.1
[2022-09-15 22:10:07] INFO  ruby 2.7.4 (2021-07-07) [x86_64-darwin21]
[2022-09-15 22:10:07] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=16658 port=9292
#+end_src

I then visited the 'http://localhost:9292' URL in a new Chrome browser and was prompted with this message:
#+begin_src text
Try this:
# in config.ru
class Shark
  get '/' do
    "Hello World"
  end
end
#+end_src

I then modified the contents of 'config.ru' with the following:
#+begin_src ruby
require "sinatra"

# NOTE: By using the '< Sinatra::Base' inheritance section, we
# are able to inherit all of the base methods from Sinatra itself:
class Shark < Sinatra::Base
    get "/" do
        "Hello World"
    end
    get "/baby_shark" do
        "<h1>&#129416 We have a baby shark!</h1>"
    end
end

run Shark
#+end_src

I then re-ran the related 'rackup config.ru' command again:
#+begin_src bash
samuelbanya@Samuels-MBP ~/hub/Development/code/phase-3/phase-3-lecture-videos-sinatra-intro
 $ rackup config.ru
[2022-09-15 22:13:06] INFO  WEBrick 1.6.1

[2022-09-15 22:13:06] INFO  WEBrick::HTTPServer#start: pid=16935 port=9292
#+end_src

I then went to the same 'http://localhost:9292/' URL again which then simply returned 'Hello World'.

I then went to the 'http://localhost:9292/baby_shark' and received the following text successfully:
#+begin_src text
ðŸ¦ˆ We have a baby shark!
#+end_src
